        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1½ cups whole milk</li>
            <li>⅔ cup cane sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                At least 12 hours before making the ice cream, freeze the bowl
                of your ice cream maker.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the heavy
                cream, whole milk, cane sugar, vanilla extract, and sea salt.
                Warm for 5 minutes, whisking often, until the sugar dissolves
                and the mixture is warmed through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the mixture to a heatproof bowl, cover, and chill in
                the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once chilled, remove the mixture from the refrigerator and whisk
                well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Churn the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the
                manufacturer's instructions, typically for 20 to 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The ice cream will have a soft texture after churning. For a
                firmer consistency, transfer it to an airtight container and
                freeze for 2 to 4 hours before serving.
            </li>
            <li>
                Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the freezer for
                up to a month. If the ice cream is too firm to scoop straight
                from the freezer, let it sit at room temperature for a few
                minutes to soften.
            </li>
