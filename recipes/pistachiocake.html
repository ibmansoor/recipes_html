    <h2>Decsription</h2>
    <p>
      This Pistachio Cake boasts a soft, moist crumb with a pronounced pistachio
      flavor, achieved by using nearly double the amount of pistachios compared
      to typical recipes. Toasting the pistachios before grinding enhances their
      nutty essence, ensuring each bite is rich and flavorful. Topped with a
      light and tangy Cream Cheese Whip, this cake offers a perfect balance of
      earthiness and subtle sweetness, making it an elegant choice for any
      occasion.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1½ cups (185g) plain flour (all-purpose flour)</li>
      <li>1¼ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda (bicarb)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>150g unsalted pistachios (shelled, unsalted)</li>
      <li>1 cup (220g) white sugar</li>
      <li>185g unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon almond extract (optional, for enhanced flavor)</li>
      <li>⅔ cup (160ml) milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the pan:</strong>
        Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Grease and line a 20
        cm / 8" round cake pan with baking paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toast the pistachios:</strong>
        Spread 125g of unsalted pistachio kernels on a baking tray and toast in
        the oven for 12 minutes until fragrant and crisp. Allow them to cool
        completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make pistachio powder:</strong>
        Once cooled, blitz the toasted pistachios into a powder using a food
        processor or blender. Be careful not to over-process into a paste; some
        small lumps are acceptable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the pistachio powder, 1 cup plain flour,
        1¼ teaspoons baking powder, ¼ teaspoon baking soda, and ¼ teaspoon salt.
        Use your fingers to break up any clumps of pistachio powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together ¾ cup plain yogurt (at room
        temperature), 60g melted unsalted butter (slightly cooled), ¼ cup plain
        oil, ¾ cup caster sugar, ½ teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 large egg (at
        room temperature) until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine wet and dry mixtures:</strong>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a
        rubber spatula to mix until the flour is almost incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add food coloring (optional):</strong>
        Add 4 drops of green food coloring to the batter and continue mixing
        until the batter is mostly lump-free. Small lumps will dissolve during
        baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Transfer to pan and bake:</strong>
        Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it out evenly.
        Bake for 40 minutes, rotating the pan at the 30-minute mark to ensure
        even browning. The cake is done when a skewer inserted into the center
        comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cool the cake:</strong>
        Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto
        a cooling rack and let it cool completely (about 1 hour).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Cream Cheese Whip:</strong>
        In a bowl, beat 100g of room-temperature cream cheese on medium-high
        speed for about 2 minutes until light and creamy. Add ¾ cup thickened
        cream, 3 tablespoons caster sugar, ½ teaspoon vanilla extract, 2
        teaspoons lemon juice (optional), and a pinch of salt. Beat until the
        mixture is softly whipped and spreadable, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frost the cake:</strong>
        Once the cake is completely cooled, spread the Cream Cheese Whip over
        the top, creating swirls with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garnish and serve:</strong>
        Sprinkle the frosted cake with finely chopped pistachios. Slice and
        serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
