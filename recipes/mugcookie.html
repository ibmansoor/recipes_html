        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in an 8-ounce
                microwave-safe mug. Microwave for about 30 seconds until mostly
                melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 4 teaspoons of packed light brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of
                granulated sugar, ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a pinch of
                salt to the melted butter. Stir with a spoon until well
                combined.
            </li>
            <li>Add 1 egg yolk to the mixture and stir until smooth.</li>
            <li>
                Stir in 3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and most of the 2
                tablespoons of semisweet chocolate chips until combined.
                Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Microwave on high for 45 seconds to 1 minute, or until the dough
                has puffed and appears dry on top.
            </li>
            <li>Allow the cookie to cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
